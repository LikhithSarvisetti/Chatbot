File-2 : Data.json

Contains all the data which is manually written on the basis of information gathered regarding my College in the json format.

My chatbot is my pure convention to help my juniors to know the basics about my college. 
As a junior I faced alot of hurdles for guidance in college which I don't want to repeat with my juniors. 
This is a demo model only.
